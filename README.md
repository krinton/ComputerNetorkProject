# ComputerNetorkProject
Data Analytics for Inferring Probing Activities

This project was done for Computer NEtwork Project class for Fall 2018, FAU (DR. Bou-Harb)

For this Project I used PHP as a front end and phpMyAdmin as a back end, hosted on the local host using WAMP server on my local computer.

As the given files were almost 8 GB of file, i used editcap.exe to split the packets file into smaller file size. Used tshark command to convert the packet file into csv file inorder to convert the pcap file into csv so that it can be uploaded on sql server.
